I've edited the hangman example to allow for upper case entries.

The udacity course does not offer a certificate for full completion. I've added screenshots of all the modules completed.

I was advised completing the Udacity course would be acceptable for the claim, if this is not the case then I'd like to continue with the submission anyway.

Kind Regards
